                Zirelia operates on a <strong>"Bring Your Own Infrastructure"</strong> model. The Software runs
                entirely on your infrastructure — the Author has no access to your data, credentials, or generated
                content.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>1. Definitions and Roles</h3>
        <p>For the purposes of GDPR and applicable privacy regulations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The User who downloads, installs, and operates the Software and is
                responsible for the personal data processed by their instance.</li>
            <li><strong>Author:</strong> Antonio Trento — provides the Software under ELv2 license but has no
                access to the User's data.</li>
            <li><strong>User Data:</strong> Any information processed by the Software instance, including persona
                configurations, API credentials, generated posts, and images stored in the User's database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Nature of Processing (Zero-Retention)</h3>
        <p>The Software is designed to operate in a fully self-contained mode:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Data (persona configs, prompts, generated content) is processed
                exclusively within the User's infrastructure (RAM and PostgreSQL database).</li>
            <li><strong>No Remote Storage by Author:</strong> The Author does not own, manage, or have any access
                to databases containing User Data.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party APIs:</strong> Data transits from the User's server to third-party APIs
                (OpenAI, Replicate, Twitter/X) as configured by the User. These are direct connections under the
                User's own accounts and credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Logs:</strong> Operational logs are saved locally on the User's filesystem and are
                never sent to the Author.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. AI-Generated Content & Data Protection</h3>
        <p>Zirelia generates text and images using AI models. From a data protection perspective:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Persona configurations (including physical trait descriptions) are stored only in the User's
                <code>config/persona.yaml</code> and database.</li>
            <li>Generated images are stored in the User's file system or cloud storage as configured.</li>
            <li>If the persona involves real-person data or likeness, the User (as Controller) is responsible for
                ensuring a lawful basis for processing under GDPR Art. 6.</li>
            <li>The User must ensure AI-generated content does not violate applicable synthetic media laws
                (e.g., EU AI Act, local deepfake regulations).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Security Measures</h3>
        <p>The Software incorporates security measures by design (Privacy by Design):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All external API connections use HTTPS/TLS.</li>
            <li>Credentials are managed via Environment Variables (<code>.env</code>), never hard-coded.</li>
            <li>No hidden telemetry or data exfiltration mechanisms are included in the Software.</li>
            <li>The Software is open-source — users may audit the full source code on GitHub.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Sub-processors</h3>
        <p>Since the Software is self-hosted, the User has direct control over all sub-processors by configuring
            the respective API keys. Key sub-processors (configured by the User, not by the Author) include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI / Anthropic:</strong> LLM inference for content generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Replicate (Black Forest Labs FLUX.1):</strong> Image generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Twitter/X API:</strong> Social media publishing.</li>
            <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Local data persistence (on User's infrastructure).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Author does not act as a contractual intermediary toward these providers.</p>

        <h3>6. User Responsibilities as Controller</h3>
        <p>As the Controller, the User is responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring a lawful basis for all data processing performed by their instance.</li>
            <li>Securing their <code>.env</code> file and API credentials.</li>
            <li>Complying with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations for any personal data processed.</li>
            <li>Reviewing AI-generated content before publication to ensure compliance with platform ToS and law.</li>
            <li>Implementing appropriate retention policies for data stored in their local database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Audits and Compliance</h3>
        <p>The Software is fully open-source under the Elastic License 2.0. Users may audit the complete source
            code on GitHub to verify the absence of backdoors, hidden data collection, or exfiltration mechanisms.
