        <h1 class="text-4xl font-black mb-8">B2B Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="lead text-xl text-gray-500 mb-8">Effective Date: {{ site.time | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</p>

        <h3>1. Scope of Policy</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to KineticMCP as a B2B software provider. It distinguishes strictly between our
            corporate website visitors and the data processed by your self-hosted instances of KineticMCP software.</p>

        <h3>2. Your Customer Data (The "Black Box" Principle)</h3>
        <p><strong>We do NOT process your Salesforce Data or AI Prompts.</strong></p>
        <p>KineticMCP is architected as a "Self-Hosted Middleware". When you install our container on your servers (AWS,
            Azure, On-Premise):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data flows strictly between <strong>Your Server</strong> <-> <strong>Your Salesforce Org</strong> <->
                        <strong>Your AI Provider</strong>.</li>
            <li>We have zero technical capability to intercept, view, or store your CRM records, prompts, or proprietary
                business logic.</li>
            <li>We are not a "Data Processor" regarding your internal business data under GDPR/CCPA, as we never access
                it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. License Validation Data</h3>
        <p>To prevent piracy and enforce license terms, the Software may periodically contact our Licensing Servers to
            verify validity. The only data transmitted during this "handshake" is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>License Key Hash.</li>
            <li>Server IP/Hostname (for seat-locking purposes).</li>
            <li>Version Number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No business data (CRM records) is ever transmitted in this payload.</p>

        <h3>4. Security of Our Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>While we do not host your KineticMCP instances, we maintain strict security over the code delivery pipeline
            (Docker Hub, Private Registries) to ensure the software artifacts you download are secure, signed, and free
            from malware.</p>

        <h3>5. Contact for Compliance</h3>
        <p>For Enterprise customers requiring Data Processing Agreements (DPA) regarding billing or account management
            data, please contact your account representative directly.</p>
