        <p class="lead text-xl text-gray-500 mb-8">Effective Date: {{ site.time | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</p>

        <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Zirelia project website (zirelia.github.io) and the open-source
            Zirelia Software. The data controller is <strong>Antonio Trento</strong>
            (<a href="mailto:info@antoniotrento.net">info@antoniotrento.net</a>), based in Italy.</p>

        <h3>2. Website Data Collection (This Site)</h3>
        <p>This website is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. It may collect the following minimal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Logs:</strong> GitHub Pages automatically logs HTTP requests (IP address, browser,
                pages visited). This data is governed by
                <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> This site may use functional cookies (e.g., to remember consent preferences).
                No tracking or advertising cookies are set without your explicit consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> If analytics are enabled, only anonymized, aggregated data is collected.
                No personal profiling is performed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. GDPR Compliance — Your Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights under the GDPR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can request deletion of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> You can request your data in a portable format.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw
                it at any time (e.g., by clearing browser cookies).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact: <a href="mailto:info@antoniotrento.net">info@antoniotrento.net</a></p>

        <h3>4. The Software — "Self-Hosted, Zero-Retention" Principle</h3>
        <p>Zirelia operates on a strict <strong>"Bring Your Own Infrastructure"</strong> model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Software runs entirely on your own servers or local machine.</li>
            <li>API keys (OpenAI, Twitter/X, Replicate) reside exclusively in your <code>.env</code> file on your
                infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Generated content (posts, images) is stored in your own PostgreSQL database.</li>
            <li>The Author has zero technical access to your instance, your data, or your credentials.</li>
            <li>No telemetry, analytics, or data is sent to the Author's servers by the Software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Third-Party Services (User-Configured)</h3>
        <p>When you configure and run Zirelia, your instance connects to third-party services that you choose and
            configure. Each of these has its own privacy policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI / Anthropic:</strong> Processes your prompts to generate text content.</li>
            <li><strong>Replicate:</strong> Processes image generation requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Twitter/X API:</strong> Receives and publishes content on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Author is not responsible for the data handling practices of these third-party services. You are
            responsible for reviewing and complying with their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h3>6. AI-Generated Content &amp; Personal Data</h3>
        <p>If your virtual influencer persona is based on a real person's likeness or identity, you are responsible
            for ensuring compliance with applicable laws on consent, synthetic media, and data protection. The Author
            does not endorse the creation of personas that impersonate real individuals without consent.</p>

        <h3>7. Marketing Communications</h3>
        <p>We do not send unsolicited marketing emails. If you voluntarily provide your email address (e.g., via a
            contact form or newsletter), it will be used solely for the purpose stated at the time of collection and
            will not be shared with third parties without your consent.</p>

        <h3>8. Data Retention</h3>
        <p>Website-level data (server logs via GitHub Pages) is retained according to GitHub's policies. Cookie
            consent preferences stored in your browser's localStorage expire with your browser session or when
            cleared manually.</p>

        <h3>9. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The effective date at the top reflects the latest
            revision. Continued use of the website or Software after changes are published constitutes acceptance
            of the updated Policy.</p>

        <h3>10. Contact</h3>
