        </p>

        <h3>2. License Grant</h3>

        <h3>3. AI Disclaimer — Autonomous Content Generation</h3>
        <p>Zirelia uses large language models (LLMs) and image generation systems to produce content autonomously.
            You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> All text and images produced by the Software are generated by
                AI models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, FLUX.1). The Author cannot guarantee accuracy, appropriateness, or
                compliance of this content with any law or platform policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Hallucinations & Errors:</strong> AI models may produce factually incorrect, offensive, or
                legally problematic outputs. You are solely responsible for reviewing content before it is published.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visual Identity:</strong> AI-generated images may unintentionally resemble real individuals.
                You must ensure that generated content does not violate applicable laws regarding likeness, defamation,
                or synthetic media (deepfakes).</li>
            <li><strong>No Liability for AI Output:</strong> The Author shall NOT be liable for any damages, legal
                claims, reputational harm, or losses arising from content generated or published by the Software.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3-bis. Synthetic Identity, Likeness &amp; AI Model Provider Liability</h3>

        <div
            style="background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.08); border: 1px solid rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2); border-radius: 12px; padding: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
            <p style="margin: 0; font-weight: bold; color: #ef4444;">⛔ REAL PERSON IMPERSONATION IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>Using Zirelia to create virtual personas that replicate, imitate, or are inspired by the identity,
            image, voice, or recognisable traits of <strong>real people</strong> is
            <strong>expressly prohibited</strong>, unless the User has obtained
            <strong>explicit written consent</strong> from the individual being represented. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prohibition of Real Identity Reproduction:</strong> It is strictly forbidden to configure
                the Software (via YAML files, LoRA models, prompts, or any other method) to generate content that
                represents, imitates, or could reasonably be confused with a real natural person, living or deceased,
                without that person's written consent (or consent from their heirs/legal representatives).</li>
            <li><strong>AI Model Provider Liability for Unintentional Resemblance:</strong> Images generated by
                the Software are produced by third-party AI diffusion models (including, but not limited to,
                FLUX.1, SDXL, provided by <strong>Replicate Inc.</strong> and the respective model developers).
                The Author of Zirelia has <strong>no control</strong> over the training data, weights, or outputs
                of these models. If a generated image unintentionally resembles a real person, the technical
                responsibility lies solely with the <strong>AI model provider</strong> (Replicate Inc. and/or the
                specific model developer) and <strong>not</strong> with the Author of Zirelia, who provides only
                the orchestration software.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with Synthetic Media (Deepfake) Laws:</strong> The User is required to comply
                with all applicable laws and regulations regarding AI-generated synthetic media, including but
                not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Italy:</strong> Art. 494 Criminal Code (identity substitution), Art. 10 Civil Code
                        (right to likeness), Legislative Decree 196/2003 and EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)</li>
                    <li><strong>European Union:</strong> EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), Art. 50 — transparency
                        obligation for AI-generated content</li>
                    <li><strong>International:</strong> All locally applicable laws on deepfakes, right of publicity,
                        defamation, and identity theft in the User's jurisdiction</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mandatory AI Labeling:</strong> In compliance with the EU AI Act and industry best practices,
                the User <strong>must</strong> clearly indicate that content published by the virtual persona is
                generated by artificial intelligence (e.g., by stating "AI-generated" or "AI-created content"
                in the social media profile bio or in the posts themselves).</li>
            <li><strong>Indemnification Clause:</strong> The User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
                the Author, collaborators, project contributors, and affiliates from and against any and all claims,
                damages, costs (including legal fees), liabilities, or legal actions brought by third parties in
                connection with: (a) the User's use of the Software; (b) content generated and/or published by the
                User through the Software; (c) infringement of intellectual property rights, likeness rights, or
                personality rights of third parties; (d) violation of any applicable law or regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>No Affiliation with Third-Party Providers:</strong> Zirelia is an independent project.
                The Author is <strong>not affiliated</strong> with, sponsored by, endorsed by, or in any way
