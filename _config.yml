faq:
  - question: "Do I need coding skills to use Zirelia?"
    answer: "Basic CLI/Docker knowledge is helpful. You only need to fill in a YAML file and run docker compose up."
  - question: "Will my account get banned?"
    answer: "Risk exists. Always read the Account Warm-Up & Anti-Ban Guide before running the bot on a live account."
  - question: "How much does it cost to run Zirelia?"
    answer: "Zirelia is free & open source. You pay only for API usage: OpenAI (~$5–20/month), Replicate (~$10–40/month), and Twitter Basic Developer access ($100/month)."
  - question: "Which social platforms are supported?"
    answer: "Currently Twitter/X only. Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram, and TikTok are on the roadmap (Phase 4–5)."
  - question: "Can I create my own persona?"
    answer: "Yes. The entire personality, appearance, voice and routine live in a single YAML config file. No code changes needed."
