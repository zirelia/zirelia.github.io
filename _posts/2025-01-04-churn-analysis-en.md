## Why are we losing deals?

It's the question that keeps VPs of Sales and CPOs awake at night.
Your CRM report says you lost 60% of opportunities in Germany this quarter. The "Loss Reason" picklist says "Product GAP" or "Price".
But that's generic. **It's not actionable.**

### The "Before" Scenario: The Black Box

To understand *why* you are losing, you have to read the notes.
*   "Liked the demo, but..."
*   "Competitor X offered..."
*   "Integration issues with..."

With thousands of opportunities, nobody does this. The "Voice of the Customer" is lost in a black hole of text fields. Decisions are made based on loud opinions rather than hard data.

## The KineticMCP Approach: Connecting the Dots

KineticMCP turns your "Closed Lost" graveyard into a goldmine of Product Intelligence.
By allowing an Agent to read thousands of loss notes, you can extract patterns that are invisible to the naked eye.

### How It Works

We asked an AI Agent via KineticMCP to act as a Product Manager:

> "Analyze all 'Closed Lost' opportunities in the Automotive sector in Germany. Identifying the #1 recurring reason for loss. Quantify EXACTLY how much revenue we lost because of this specific reason."

### The "After" Scenario

The Agent didn't just count keywords. It understood the context.

1.  **Pattern Recognition**: It noticed that 3 out of 6 lost deals mentioned "SAP Integration" or "Native SAP Connector".
2.  **Revenue Attribution**: It didn't just say "It's a problem". It calculated the cost: **"We lost €450k this quarter due to lack of SAP integration."**
3.  **The Memo**: It wrote a data-backed memo to the VP of Product: *"Developing an SAP connector should be priority #1. Immediate ROI is €450k/quarter."*

### Business Impact

*   **R&D Prioritization**: Stop building features you *think* people want. Build features that have a verified price tag attached to them.
*   **Market Alignment**: Real-time feedback from the frontline to the engineering team.
*   **Sales Confidence**: Sales reps know their feedback is actually being read and acted upon.

Stop guessing. Let KineticMCP quantify your roadmap.
