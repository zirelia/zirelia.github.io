## The Missing Layer

For the last 20 years, we've treated Salesforce as a database. We put data in, we pull data out.
But as AI agents become capable of reasoning and executing complex tasks, they need more than just a REST API. They need a **System of Action**.

### Enter KineticMCP

KineticMCP is designed to bridge the gap between your enterprise AI strategy and your System of Record.
By exposing Salesforce via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, we enable any LLM—be it Claude, OpenAI, or a local Llama model—to understand your schema, respect your validation rules, and execute business logic safely.

### Why Now?

Copilots are useful, but they are often limited to a single application.
The true power of Agentic AI lies in cross-application workflows. KineticMCP allows your agents to orchestrate processes that span Salesforce, Slack, ERPs, and more, without brittle integration scripts.

We are excited to build this future with you.
**Join our Founding Partners program** to get early access and shape the roadmap.
